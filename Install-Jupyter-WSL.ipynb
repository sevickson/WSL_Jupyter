    "This Jupyter Notebook gives you the possibility to very easily setup a WSL lab for developing cross-platform Notebooks.  \n",

    "\n",
    "I use this Notebook in Visual Studio Code but it can also be used in Jupyter Lab without any issues.  \n",
    "The reason it is near-simultaneous is because normally changes to textfiles or like .py files are immediately visible in the other instance of Visual Code when you use the `File -> Auto Save` function.   \n",
    "Probably because a .ipynb Notebook is actually a JSON file that later is generated to become the Jupyter Notebook, the file needs to be reloaded, closed/opened, to see the changes."
