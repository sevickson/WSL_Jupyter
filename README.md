I developed this Notebook to be able to deploy a WSL Linux Distribution ready for Jupyter Notebook development.  
I use it in Visual Studio Code but this Notebook can also be run in Jupyter Lab.

This repo is divided in the [Notebook](install-jupyter-wsl.ipynb) itself and the `req` folder where the functions and other requirements are placed.
